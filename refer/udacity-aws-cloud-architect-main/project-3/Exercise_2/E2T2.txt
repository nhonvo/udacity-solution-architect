Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1. IAM policy is allowing full S3 access
2. Can access to port 5000 on EC2 instance from the internet
3. Security Group is allowing access from any addresses, any ports, and any protocols
4. LoadBalancer does not have HTTP->HTTPs redirection
5. CloudTrail is not specified

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

1. Config IAM policy that allow only necessary permissions
2. Disable port 5000 on EC2 instance
3. Remove unneccessary traffics on Security Group
4. Add HTTP->HTTPs redirection for LoadBalancer to redirect all http request to https
5. Setup CloudTrail and store logs in S3
